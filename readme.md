# McDonald's Banner Animation Task

Welcome to the McDonald's banner animation task! Your goal is to create an engaging banner animation using the provided resources. This task helps us evaluate your coding skills, creativity, and ability to deliver results based on clear design specifications.

## Task Overview

This repository contains:

- `index.html`
- `script.js`
- `style.css`
- Images needed for the banner (in the `img` folder)

Your objective is to create a banner that mirrors the animation in the provided reference video.

### Video Reference (Final Result):

[Banner Animation Example (12-second duration)](https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/798747299/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=fab2d1d86734ba7b7ad446cb6cf119ce7667549ed9c0867623572f2f8775e83c)

### Requirements:

- **Duration**: The animation should last exactly 12 seconds, as shown in the video, and loop continuously.
- **Dimensions**: The banner should have a fixed width of 500px and a height of 1000px.

### Flexibility in Approach:

You are free to implement the animation using the method of your choice. Some options include:

- CSS-only animations
- JavaScript animations
- JavaScript animation libraries

However, the final goal is to keep the overall file size of the banner as small as possible. This means:

- **Use minified versions** of any animation libraries you include.
- **No external links** (e.g., CDN-hosted libraries). Any external libraries must be downloaded and added to the repository locally.

## Extra Points (Bonus)

You can earn additional points for implementing the following:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the banner resizes proportionally to the width or height of the browser window. See this video for reference:

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:

1. **Functionality**: The banner should closely match the video, including the animation timing and behavior.
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-structured code that follows best practices is key.
3. **Attention to Detail**: We appreciate candidates who show attention to small details.
4. **Commit History**: We will also evaluate how you structure your commits. Multiple well-organized commits that represent incremental progress are encouraged. A single commit at the end is less ideal.
   - **Important**: Once you've completed the task, please make a final commit with the message `FINAL` so we know you've finished your work.
5. **File Size**: Keep the total file size of the banner as small as possible by using minified libraries and optimizing your code. Avoid unnecessary bloat.
6. **Responsiveness (Bonus)**: Extra points for making the banner resize dynamically, maintaining proportionality across different screen sizes.

## Submission Instructions

Once you've completed the task, make a final commit with the message `FINAL` and push your changes directly to this repository.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your animation works across modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge).
- If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to Tamar at tamar@codevelop.io.
